        <p> From my experience of Paris there is so much to do, it can't be done in simply a couple of days. However a couple of days is more than enough to gather a sample of what Paris has to offer. </p>

        <p> There are always things to do : 
        
        <ol class="list" id="olist">
        <li> Visiting attractions  </li>
        <li> Walking along the boulevards </li>
        <li> Sampling the culinary delights Paris has to offer. </li>

</ol>
