</p>

<p> <strong> Step 1: </strong>Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan or saucepan and cook the spring onions over a medium-high heat for a few seconds. Add the rice and cook over a low heat for about 1 min, stirring all the time until the rice looks glossy but not brown. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 2: </strong> Add the garlic and mushrooms, then pour in about half the hot stock and stir well. Cook over a medium heat for 20-25 mins, stirring often and gradually and adding the remaining stock a little at a time until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.

</p>

<p> <strong> Step 3: </strong>       Check that the rice is tender. It should have a nice creamy texture. If it needs cooking for a bit longer, add a little more hot water.</p>


<p> <strong> Step 4:</strong>  Add the peas, stirring gently to mix them in. Check the seasoning, adding some pepper if needed. Serve. </p>

        <p>Finely chop the onions and peel and deseed the squash.</p>
        <p> Don't forget to Boil the kettle for the chicken stock!
</p>

<p> <strong> Step 1: </strong>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil with 25g butter. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook on a low heat for 10 mins or until soft. Add 60g bacon and cook for a further 5 mins until the bacon releases its fat. Then increase the heat to medium, add the pumpkin and stock and season. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for about 40 mins until the pumpkin is soft. Pour in the cream, bring to the boil again and remove from the heat. Set aside some of the liquid, then blend the remaining pumpkin until smooth and velvety, adding liquid back into the pan bit by bit as you go (add more liquid if you like it thinner). Strain through a fine sieve, check the seasoning and set aside. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 2: </strong> Melt the remaining butter in a pan over a high heat and fry the rest of the bacon with black pepper for 5 mins. Divide the bacon between four bowls, reheat the soup and pour over. To serve, sprinkle over the pumpkin seeds and drizzle with maple syrup.

        <p> Don't forget to Boil the kettle for the vegetable stock!
</p>

<p> <strong> Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Boil the beetroot in slightly salted water, peel and cut into 3mm/â…›in slices. Place the beetroot into a bowl and mix with two tablespoons of the olive oil and mustard. Fry the leek in the remaining oil until soft. </p>

<p> <strong> Step 2: </strong> 
Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, stir in the flour then add the milk in a steady stream until it is all incorporated. Add a grating of nutmeg and a pinch of black pepper then the Cheddar and finally the leeks. Mix until well combined and remove the pan from the heat.
</p>

<p> <strong> Step 3: </strong>       
Put a layer of beetroot in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, spoon over some sauce then add a layer of ham. Repeat these layers, finishing with a layer of sauce and a scattering parmesan.</p>


<p> <strong> Step 4:</strong>  Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden-brown. </p>
