    <p> So far I feel this course has provided me with a useful starting point to continue to develop my skills as a web developer. </p>

    <p> Learning Html and CSS I have had a bit of background knowledge in but Khan Academy provide the opportunity for more hands-on work than I have previously completed. </p>

    <p> The quick videos are a useful refresher option with the challenges giving me some experience so I can feel confident enough I have been able to work through the project sections with the mindset of being able to complete them. </p>

    <p> So far I have discovered I learn best by doing. </p>


    <p> Mediation techniques are useful to not only enhance the mind but also provide the opportunity to work on your body and getting used to how it really feels.</p>

    <p> Pomodoro technique is something which can be used to concentrate in 25 minute periods for one task which I have found useful when I wish to hone my mind</p>

    <p> Github is great for hosting code writen. </p>
